## What makes Cardano Starter Kit?
### Every CSK should include the following:
1. Guiding questions, Learning Targets and Outcomes as modeled above
2. Video lessons
3. Written documentation
4. One or more calls to action - could be different depending on audience

### CSKs might also include
1. Sample code
2. PBL tasks
3. Links to additional resources, further reading, suggested projects

### Of course, you might have better ideas
So treat these guidelines as flexible! If you see a better way to get people started in what you're trying to do, test your ideas.

## Process
### Step 1: Draft Guiding Questions
If you intend to create a Cardano Starter Kit, you probably already have some ideas about what you want to share with other people. Start by summarizing your intentions in one or two "guiding questions". What 
### Step 2: Draft Outcomes and Learning Targets
- Links
- What is the difference between a Learning Target and an Outcome

Think of Learning Targets like a horizon - you can move toward it, but there's always room to learn more.
Think of Outcomes as tangible expectations - what, precisely will someone know and be able to do after looking at this CSK?

### Step 3: Define your audiences
The purpose of a CSK is to get people started on their own learning journey, and outcomes might be different for newcomers to Cardano vs people who want to learn to build with Cardano. We like to think about what each of these groups might get out of a CSK:
- How might a blockchain novice benefit from this CSK? How might this CSK expose an end user to what Cardano can do?
- How might an experienced developer benefit from this CSK? What do you want devs to get out of this CSK?
- Prerequisites - list if any?
- Read, Write, Execute permissions

Optional Step: make a chart LTs x Audiences - provide a sample

### Step 4: Create an Outline
Now that you've defined your intentions, it's time to outline your CSK. You may already a draft of an outline - that's great. Look at your Learning Targets and Outcomes. How will you move people toward these LTs, and how will make sure the Outcomes can happen? As you draft your outline, gather relevant links and visual resources. 
- Do you need slide deck?
    - to share key definitions? One way to answer this question is to look at your list of Learning Targets: are there any words in these LTs that need to be defined before you start your lessons?
