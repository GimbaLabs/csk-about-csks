# How to Create a Cardano Starter Kit
## The "CSK about CSKs"

### Intended Audience
You should take a look at this starter kit if you'd like to learn about our intentions at Gimbalabs, or if you're thinking about contributing your own Cardano Starter Kit!

### Guiding Questions
1. What is a Cardano Starter Kit?
2. Why should I make a Cardano Starter Kit?
3. How do I make one?

### Learning Targets
1. I understand the purpose of Cardano Starter Kits.
2. I understand the education design principles behind Cardano Starter Kits.
3. I can explain why context and schema help drive adoption of new technology.

### Outcomes
At the end of this starter kit, you will:
1. Have ideas for future starter kits and how you might contribute.
2. Be ready to create your own starter kit!

## Part 1: Why should you make a Cardano Starter Kit?
Cardano Starter Kits exist because people learn best through experience. The roll-out of Cardano comes with so many possibilities that it's hard to even make sense of everything it can do.

That is why we emphasize *context*. Knowledge will always be essential, and in order to *use* it, we must be able to incorporate it into the web of what we already know. That process is called sense-making; our webs of knowledge are called [schema](https://blog.mindresearch.org/blog/schema-in-education). 

One of the best ways to facilitate sense-making and schema-building is to expose people to problems in a real-world context, and to equip people to try to solve those problems on their own. Gimbalabs seeks to help people build rich schema for what Cardano can do by providing context through project-based, experiential learning. You should make a Cardano Starter Kit if you know a way to help people on that journey. 

Here are some specific examples of what that might mean:
- You can provide context that helps people make sense of technical documentation so that they can then dive deeper on their own. Perhaps you've read official docs and experienced some pain points, so now you're ready to help people navigate the same.
- You've built a tool that can support others to build on Cardano and you want to show how it works, so that others can start using it.
- Through your experience with Cardano you've developed insights that might help someone else get started on their own learning journey, and you can share these in a way that facilitates experiential, project- and problem-based learning
    - You have an idea for how to expose end users to what Cardano can do
    - You have an idea for how to show experienced devs what Cardano can do
    - Some CSKs will focus more on devs, some on end-users, and others will address both audiences - you decide!

In all cases, CSKs provide a starting point. CSKs should define next steps, calls to action, and further reading.

## Part 2: What makes Cardano Starter Kit?
### Every CSK should include the following:
1. Guiding questions, Learning Targets and Outcomes as modeled above
2. Video lessons
3. Written documentation
4. Links to additional resources + further reading
5. One or more calls to action - could be different depending on audience

### CSKs might also include
1. Sample code
2. PBL tasks
3. References to and usage examples for [Dandelion's open source APIs](https://gimbalabs.com/#/open-source-apis)

### Of course, you might have better ideas!
So treat these guidelines as flexible! If you see a better way to get people started in what you're trying to do, test your ideas.

## Part 3: How to Create a Cardano Starter Kit
### Step 1: Draft Guiding Questions
If you intend to create a Cardano Starter Kit, you probably already have some ideas about what you want to share with other people. Start by summarizing your intentions in one or two "guiding questions". What 
### Step 2: Draft Outcomes and Learning Targets
- Links
- What is the difference between a Learning Target and an Outcome

Think of Learning Targets like a horizon - you can move toward it, but there's always room to learn more.
Think of Outcomes as tangible expectations - what, precisely will someone know and be able to do after looking at this CSK?

### Step 3: Define your audiences
The purpose of a CSK is to get people started on their own learning journey, and outcomes might be different for newcomers to Cardano vs people who want to learn to build with Cardano. We like to think about what each of these groups might get out of a CSK:
- How might a blockchain novice benefit from this CSK? How might this CSK expose an end user to what Cardano can do?
- How might an experienced developer benefit from this CSK? What do you want devs to get out of this CSK?
- Prerequisites - list if any?
- Read, Write, Execute permissions

Optional Step: make a chart LTs x Audiences - provide a sample

### Step 4: Create an Outline
Now that you've defined your intentions, it's time to outline your CSK. You may already a draft of an outline - that's great. Look at your Learning Targets and Outcomes. How will you move people toward these LTs, and how will make sure the Outcomes can happen? As you draft your outline, gather relevant links and visual resources. 
- Do you need slide deck?
    - to share key definitions? One way to answer this question is to look at your list of Learning Targets: are there any words in these LTs that need to be defined before you start your lessons?

- Options for chunking content

### Step 5: Record Videos
Don't worry about being polished - be relatable. Welcome people in.
Options for chunking content...


### Step 6: Revisit Outcomes and Learning Targets
Revisit outcomes + learning targets. Did you cover these in your videos? Did any surprises emerge? Revise outcomes and LTâ€™s accordingly - it's ok to reword things a bit if videos helped with clarifying these points

### Step 7: Add written documentation 
- video links + timestamps
- external links
- embedded links to code samples
- step by step call(s) to action
 - appropriate level of documentation (this is a moving target, depending on audience)
- (see https://github.com/GimbaLabs/csk-003, https://github.com/GimbaLabs/csk-005)


### Step 8: Write Introduction, Intended Audience/You Should ... If...
We like to put written docs on GitHub, with timestamped links to videos, etc. But we're always open to suggestions (and we'd really like to build a high-value social network...)
